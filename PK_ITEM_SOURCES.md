## DroidForums tutorial notes (high‑level gameplay/economy tips)
Source: https://www.droidforums.net/threads/parallel-kingdom-tutorial-pk.79603/

- Early‑game loop: finish tutorial, relocate, use City Ticket, build a golem to collect crude oil daily.
- Economy tips: berries farming/tending trees; backpacks for storage; trade posts add 10% tax; drop‑trade avoids tax but has scam risk.
- Travel/territory: flags, guard towers, roc shrines; roc feathers for travel.
- Risk management: purses to protect gold on death.
- Weekly hats: multiple hat categories tied to activities (wood, leather, iron, hunting, upgrades, etc.).
